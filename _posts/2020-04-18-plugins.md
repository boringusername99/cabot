### Plugins

Plugins can be used to add new alerting and check functionality to Cabot. The list below is provided as a reference and these plugins have not necessarily been validated. Test and use at your own risk.

### Installing plugins

Installing plugins with the recommended Docker installation requires some extra work to build a custom Docker image to install the plugin from PyPi.

1. Create your own Dockerfile
```
    FROM cabotapp/cabot:0.11.13
    RUN pip install cabot_alert_telegram
```
2. Build a new container
```
    docker build -t foobar/cabot:latest .
```
3. Verify that pip install worked
```
    docker run -it  foobar/cabot:latest /bin/sh
    pip freeze
```    
Expected output
```
    ...
    botocore==1.10.26
    cabot==0.11.13
    cabot-alert-email==1.4.3
    cabot-alert-hipchat==2.0.3
    cabot-alert-slack==0.8.3
    cabot-alert-telegram==0.6
    cabot-alert-twilio==1.3.3
    cabot-check-cloudwatch==0.1.2
    celery==4.0.2
    ...
```
4. Update the docker-compose file to reference the new image
```
    web:
        image: foobar/cabot:latest
```

5. Update the conf/default.env file to add the new plugin (or if multiple, separate by commas
```
    CABOT_PLUGINS_ENABLED=cabot_alert_email,cabot_alert_telegram
```
